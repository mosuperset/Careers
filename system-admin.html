                <h3>A day in the life of the career </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A typical workday for a System Administrator would go as follows. 
                            They start their day in the office reviewing their emails and device management suite. 
                            They will attend meetings and complete troubleshooting tickets remotely or in-person created by coworkers. 
                            In the emergency of a critical issue such as a server shutdown, the System Administrator would prioritize solving the shutdown to minimize any 
                            damage and keep up its service and, in turn, productivity. Throughout the process, they would tabulate their findings in technical documents to be 
                            discussed with differing levels of the company and investigate ways to avoid the problem or implement better systems that cause fewer problems.  </li>
                    </ul>
