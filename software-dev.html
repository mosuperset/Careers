        <li>
            A typical day for a software engineer consists of a lot of coding. \ A software engineer constantly manages multiple software projects, writes new code, and collaborates with coworkers to solve problems. 
            As needed, software engineers revise and rewrite other people's code. Another common task is creating prototypes for clients. Understanding client expectations and developing prototypes is required. 
            Software engineers often work alone. They work with project managers, user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) designers, data scientists, and other team members. In addition, they attend meetings and manage emails.
