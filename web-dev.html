Problem-solving is the heart of the industry. As the field of web development is still young and thriving, some problems are yet to be solved, and most have multiple solutions. Picking the right solution for the circumstances will save you and your employer a lot of time, money, and effort.  </p>
            <p>As for future employers, your options are almost limitless. Every entity and or person with a website is a potential employer. Thus, big tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, Meta, Twitter, and others are not that far from your reach.</p>
